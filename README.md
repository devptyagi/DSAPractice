* Find largest element index
* Check if array is sorted
* Remove duplicates from sorted array
* Move all zeroes to the end
* Left rotate array by one
* Rotate array 'D' times

## Recursion

* Print 1 to N using recursion.
* Factorial of a number
* Count digits in a number
* Sum of digits
* Print elements of array using recursion
* Sum of N natural numbers
* Print Nth Fibonacci Number
* nCr [Combinations: Choose R objects from N objects]
* Check is a number is palindrome
* Euclid's GCD Algorithm

## Hashing

* Count non repeating elements
* Print non repeating character in a string

## Strings

* Count words in a string
* Convert to Lower Case
* Convert to Upper Case
* String Validation
* Check is string is a panagram
* Find missing characters from panagram

* Check if two strings are anagrams
* Find if there is an anagram of given pattern present in given string

## Searching

* Binary Search [Iterative]
* Binary Search [Recursive]
* Find first occurence of element using binary search [Iterative]
* Find first occurence of element using binary search [Recusrive]
* Find majority element (That appears more than n/2 times)
* Find square root floor of given number 

## Sorting 

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
